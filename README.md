### Reflection

I am starting to have to become comfortable with letting go of control since I am realizing that my skill set doesnt allow for me to have any other option. Since I am new to code I find myself wanting to do more and having many ideas, but little idea for execution. I still have a final vision in my mind for what theme I would like to explore, but going through this discovery process has been great to help me realize what else I could add to my idea. Some of my sketches have lost intended aesthetics but I still feel I am learning valuable lessons and look forward to bringing it all together.
